# LICPP
Lisp Flavoured C++

## About
A tiny library that implements some basic Lisp (mainly Common Lisp) utilities as a DSL, currently just a toy.

## Contributing
All functions should be (preferably) implemented in the same way as its corresponding definition in [CLHS](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw70/CLHS/Front/X_AllSym.htm).
